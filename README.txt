**REPO UPDATE**

- All website material will be hosted here for the time being
- All programmed tests and provided logs and images for documentation
have been moved to the drive

These changes have been made to cleanup the repo and to better navigate the
past prototypes, documentation and testing.

Documentation was initially going to be the only move from the repo to the drive, 
but because the code is important for understanding and running the respective tests, 
the drive will hold those tests as well to prevent confusion from splitting up the files
between the repo and drive.

Additionally, these tests don't see many iterative changes since they
are running smaller circuits/prototypes, so there would be no benefit to hosting
those files on Github if they are not subjected to change over time.

For now, the drive will host all documentation and testing for hardware, while
the repo will be mainly used for the website. We may host this documentation
on a separate website or repo dedicated to documentation, but for the time 
being the repo will host prototypes and code deemed to be "final."
