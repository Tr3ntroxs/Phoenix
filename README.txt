**REPO UPDATE**

- CAD has been moved to a Google drive as files are heavy and don't see many
changes in the repo once uploaded
- All programmed tests and provided logs and images for documentation
have been copied to the drive, but will remain on Github as open-source
material and for later reference
- File structure for tests changed

These changes have been made to cleanup the repo and to better navigate the
past prototypes, documentation and testing, as well as closing down CAD for
revision.

For now, the drive will host most files and be considered a comprehensive 
private portfolio, while the repo will be mainly used for website, testing, 
and as a timeline for changes in code and documentation that may remain open-source.
