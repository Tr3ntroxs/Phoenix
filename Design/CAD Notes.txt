Design notes:
- Bottom segment of fingers will only be able to rotate roughly 20 degrees up.
This will operate as a good hardstop, so I will look to put rubber padding/stops
in between.
- Parts with holes might need to be printed on side.

February 10th, 2022:

- Optimized finger dimensions

Design notes:
- I need to start doing interior design inside the palm
- Looking at the fingers themselves, a spring mechanism might help to keep
them from clasping inside
