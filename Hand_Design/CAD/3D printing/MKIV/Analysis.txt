Base print did fail halfway through (possibly due to other finger components), but did not
really need a reprint. However, some of the dimensions must be redone, and because we
are trying out a prosthetic given to us by Turner, I will also add this onto a mount for that
hand and look to implement it in the final design.

Finger (MKIV, scaled 125% so final print will be smaller):

Pros:

- Looks much better than MKIII
- Has surfaces to support grip on objects
- Structural strength
- Better bending angles
- Less print used

Yea, works out better than before. However, I think it could use some lofting features
to better mimic the shape of a finger, and despite it being upscaled I think it's a bit
wide overall. Will look into this if there is time for a print of my own model.
