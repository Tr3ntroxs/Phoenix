Pros:

- Looks better
- Has surfaces to support grip on objects
- Structural strength

Cons:

- Odd bending angles
- May use a lot more print than previous design

Might use this as the basis for final design of the finger, but
needs to be fine-tuned for better functionality. Cuts will also
be made near the joints to retain structural integrity while
reducing print load by a lot.
