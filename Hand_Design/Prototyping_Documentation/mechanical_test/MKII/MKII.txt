Moving on to more component pieces, we tested 3D finger designs. We came up with a parallel board design with spacers in the middle
acting as pulleys to contract the finger. The finger had to conceal the string to hold objects and the servo was repositioned
to the back of the hand to allow objects to be held in the palm.

Currently testing finger design and will move onto actual wood fingers next time.

Eventually, replicable parts will be modeled in CAD and laser cut from cardboard to the correct dimensions and fit for fast 
and effecient repairs and production scalability. Materials can be then switched wood later.
