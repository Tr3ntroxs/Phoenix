MyoWare® 2.0 Muscle Sensor - Documentation

Introduction
The MyoWare® 2.0 Muscle Sensor offers an exciting way to control devices using the electrical signals generated by our muscles.
Say goodbye to buttons, levers, and joysticks, and say hello to muscle-powered control! This Arduino-compatible, all-in-one electromyography (EMG) sensor 
from Advancer Technologies has been redesigned with a user-friendly, compact design and upgraded chipset for improved performance and reliability. 
With the innovative snap connector system, no soldering is required, making it effortless to use the MyoWare 2.0 ecosystem. 
Simply attach a few electrodes (not included), read the output voltage, and flex your muscles!

How It Works
The MyoWare 2.0 Muscle Sensor measures muscle activity through the electric potential of the muscle, known as surface electromyography (EMG or sEMG). 
When your brain signals a muscle to flex, an electrical signal is sent to recruit motor units, which are bundles of muscle fibers responsible for generating muscle force.
The harder you flex, the more motor units are recruited, leading to increased electrical activity in the muscle. 
The MyoWare 2.0 Muscle Sensor analyzes this electrical activity, providing an output signal (ranging from 0 to VIN volts, where VIN is the voltage of the power source)
that represents the muscle's strength of contraction.

Key Features

    Wearable Design: Attach biomedical sensor pads directly to the sensor board for a clean and compact setup.
    Supply Voltage: Operates on a single-supply voltage of +3.3V to +5V, ensuring compatibility with various microcontrollers.
    Three Output Modes: Choose from raw EMG, rectified, and envelope modes for flexible data processing.
    Reverse Polarity Protection: Built-in protection for power pins against reverse polarity.
    LED Indicators: VIN and ENV LEDs provide visual feedback for easy monitoring.
    Expandable via Shields: Easily stack compatible shields to enhance versatility and functionality.
    Connector System: The snap connector system simplifies shield stacking and connection to input electrodes.
