Output used - ENV
ENV is a combination of the RAW and RECT outputs, which will likely give us the most
accurate info for testing.

As shown in image, sensor was placed on forearm. Output did indicate responsiveness, but
different spots may need to be tried for better effect. Will test this on prototype build
of finger next time.
