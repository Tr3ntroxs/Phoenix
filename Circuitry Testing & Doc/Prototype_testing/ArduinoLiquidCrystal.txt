The Arduino LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a commonly used peripheral module that interfaces 
with Arduino microcontrollers. It serves as a visual output device, allowing users to display 
text and graphics for various applications. The LCD module typically consists of a monochrome 
or color screen, with the most popular being 16x2 or 20x4 character configurations.

To control the LCD, Arduino developers can use various libraries and functions to display text, 
numbers, and symbols. The interface usually involves a parallel or serial connection between the 
Arduino board and the LCD, depending on the specific module used. Some advanced LCD modules come 
with additional features like backlight control, touchscreen capabilities, or different screen 
technologies.

The Arduino LCD module is widely used in projects ranging from simple temperature and humidity 
monitors to more complex systems like home automation, digital dashboards, and interactive devices. 
Its ease of use, affordability, and compatibility with the Arduino ecosystem make it a popular 
choice among hobbyists, students, and professionals for adding visual feedback to their projects.

The 16 pins of the parallel interface on the LCD are typically organized as follows:

VSS (Ground): Connected to the ground (0V) of the power supply.
VDD (Power): Connected to the positive power supply voltage (typically +5V).
V0 (Contrast Control): Used to adjust the contrast of the display.
RS (Register Select): Selects between data (RS=1) and command (RS=0) mode.
R/W (Read/Write): Selects between read (R/W=1) and write (R/W=0) mode.
E (Enable): Used to enable or clock the data/command into the LCD.
7 to 14. D0 to D7 (Data): These are the 8 data pins used for sending character data and commands to the LCD.
LED+ (Backlight Anode): Connected to the positive side of the backlight LED (optional).
LED- (Backlight Cathode): Connected to the negative side of the backlight LED (optional).
